# Safe Eats
## INST377 Team17

With this app, we are trying to solve the information problem of locating specific facilities faster and helping individuals find places they feel more comfortable eating at. Someone who is not familiar with an area could have difficulty locating certain food facilities that meet their needs. Modern society is fast-paced and places a lot of emphasis on efficiency, and people are always looking for a way to get useful information as quickly as possible. Our system will have a filter feature which will allow users to look for restaurants that meet specific requirements.

The target browsers for this app are Google Chrome and iOS.
