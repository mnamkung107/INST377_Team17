      With this app, we are trying to solve the information problem of locating details about various food facilities faster and helping individuals find places they feel more comfortable eating at. 
      Someone who is not familiar with an area could have difficulty locating certain food facilities that meet their needs. 
      Modern society is fast-paced and places a lot of emphasis on efficiency, and people are always looking for a way to get useful information as quickly as possible. 
      Our system will have a filter feature which will allow users to narrow down the results and meet their specific needs.
    </p>

    <p class="body_content">
      This app allows the user to search for food service facilities (restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, etc.).
      The user is able to filter by category (bakery, grocery store, full service, fast food, etc.) and closest location.
      The system would also let the user know if any of the facilities have “critical violations” or have failed their food inspection.
      For example, if the user wants to buy coffee on their way to work, they would be able to find all of the coffee shops in the area and check if the coffee shop is safe.
