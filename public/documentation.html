            <li>Link to where app is running: inst377-team17.herokuapp.com</li>
            <li>Information problem you're trying to solve: The information problem that we are trying to solve 
              is being unable to locate health information about various food facilities in an area 
              you may not be familiar with.</li>
            <li>Identified stakeholders/target browsers: First-time travelers or even locals to the Prince George’s County Area looking for a sanitary place to eat. </li>
            <li>Data you chose to work with: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2iz </li>
            <li>Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem: the solustion is to build a web application allowing quick lookups, 
              filter options, health violation warnings and locations on one system.
            </li>
            <li>Technical system decision rationale: The rationale for our system is to build something similar 
              to Google Maps that would only look at restaurant near the user's location and bring up information 
              about the healthiness of the food.
            </li>
            <li>How/if your final system helps to address the problem: The app helps to address the problem by 
              letting the user know if any of the facilities have “critical violations” or have failed their food inspection.</li>
            <li>Challenges faced and impact on final design: 
              <ul>
                <li>Using/connecting to Heroku was difficult</li>
                <li>Understanding how to access the server and pass specific information through</li>
                <li>Pinpointing location for user on maps and getting all of the restaurants implemented.</li>
                <li>Determining what specific restaurants violation info was not useful enough</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Possible future work directions with this problem: Some of the possible future work things that 
              we looking towards is to try and find a way to allow the user to search by location and allowing 
              user reviews to be added.
