## Information problem you're trying to solve

The information problem that we are trying to solve is being unable to locate health information about various food facilities in an area you may not be familiar with.

## Identified stakeholders/target browsers

First-time travelers or even locals to the Prince George’s County Area looking for a sanitary place to eat.

## Data you chose to work with

https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2izM

## Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem

To build a web application that allows quick lookups, filter options by category, and excludes facilities with health code violations all on one system.

## Technical system decision rationale

To build something similar to Google Maps and Yelp that would allow you to look at restaurants nearby based on the category the user wants and helps the user avoid facilities that have health code violations.

## How/if your final system helps to address the problem

The app helps to address the problem by displaying a list of restaurants based on category and excluding any facilities that have failed their health code inspections.

## Challenges faced and impact on final design

* Using/connecting to Heroku
* Understanding how to access the server and pass specific information through
* Pinpointing location for user on maps and getting all of the restaurants implemented
* Determining what specific info was necessary

## Possible future work directions with this problem

* Try to figure out a way for the user to search by location
* Allow user reviews to be added
        * Anonymous Tip-line
* Make sure map shows location markers
        * Display addresses
* Work on design

# Final Report
## Safe Eats

**Our team members:** Michelle Namkung, Aisha Koroma, Jason Jiang, Ayesha Shafquat, Japheth Mulugeta and Myles Lane

The app can be found running [Here](https://inst377-team17.herokuapp.com/index.html "Safe Eats").

The information problem that we are trying to solve is being unable to locate health information about various food facilities in an area you may not be familiar with. The stakeholders and target users for our app include first-time travelers and locals to the Prince George’s County Area looking for a sanitary place to eat.

We chose to work with the Prince George’s County Food Inspection Dataset found [on their website](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2iz). It contains data on the compliance of food service facilities across PG County and is a reliable data source that is updated daily.

Our solution for this problem was to build a web application that allows rapid searching and filtering through categories to find food service facilities that are in compliance with the health code all on one system.
The technical system decision rationale was to build something similar to Google Maps and Yelp that would allow the user to look at restaurants nearby based on the category they want and help them avoid facilities that have health code violations.

Our team believes the app addresses the problem by displaying a list of restaurants based on category and excluding any facilities that have failed their health code inspections.

### Challenges

**Back End:**
- Using/connecting to Heroku
- Understanding how to access the server and pass specific information through
- Pinpointing location for user on maps and getting all of the restaurants implemented
- Determining what specific info was necessary

**Front End:**
- A lot of styling issues
- Trying to add animations took a long time
- CSS Sheet is messy and caused some confusion

Many of the issues came from a lack of time. Ideas would all take a significant amount of time to research and code but our lack of time meant we needed to scrap the ideas in order to complete the project on time. This could have been avoided by less procrastination and more communication.

We did have to make some changes from our original interface. At first, when the user would filter through what place they would like to eat. Every option would appear after clicking “Apply” and those that did not pass health code violations, had a red dot next to it and those that passed had a green dot. We found this as not necessarily and we did not believe that the user needs to know of the locations/restaurants that are not sanitary and because of that we omitted the places that did not pass. So if the user chooses to eat at a bakery, only those that passed health code inspections would appear.

### For the Future

One possible direction our team considered for the future is allowing anonymous users or employees to leave reviews or tips about the facilities they are at. This would be something like a "tip-line".
