## Information problem you're trying to solve

The information problem that we are trying to solve is being unable to locate health information about various food facilities in an area you may not be familiar with.

## Identified stakeholders/target browsers

First-time travelers or even locals to the Prince Georgeâ€™s County Area looking for a sanitary place to eat.

## Data you chose to work with

https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2izM

## Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem

To build a web application that allows quick lookups, filter options by category, and excludes facilities with health code violations all on one system.

## Technical system decision rationale

To build something similar to Google Maps and Yelp that would allow you to look at restaurants nearby based on the category the user wants and helps the user avoid facilities that have health code violations.

## How/if your final system helps to address the problem

The app helps to address the problem by displaying a list of restaurants based on category and excluding any facilities that have failed their health code inspections.

## Challenges faced and impact on final design

* Using/connecting to Heroku
* Understanding how to access the server and pass specific information through
* Pinpointing location for user on maps and getting all of the restaurants implemented
* Determining what specific info was necessary

## Possible future work directions with this problem

* Try to figure out a way for the user to search by location
* Allow user reviews to be added
        * Anonymous Tip-line
* Make sure map shows location markers
        * Display addresses
* Work on design
